# I2C Slave Mode for ATtiny85

This is a fork from [sudar/TinyWire](https://github.com/sudar/TinyWire) that removes extra library that add support for enabling master. If you are looking for a more fully featured Arduino library please refer to the documentation provided there.

## Purpose

You will find this library helpful if you use the official Arduino IDE and plan to add I2C slave mode to ATtiny85's. The motivation of this repository is to make importing this library easier, fix linking issues I was experiencing, and make the import lighter.

I would consider this library Experimental. This library works for me and the purposes I have tried it with, but I have no guarantees it will work for you or in all cases. Please feel free to submit pull requests either here or at [sudar/TinyWire](https://github.com/sudar/TinyWire). I'm just trying to figure this out (not expert), while the maintainers of the original repository might be of more help.

## Installation

To install the library, download or checkout the source code and place it inside your Arduino's libraries folder.

## Credits

This library was originally written by [Bro Hogan](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/USIi2c) with contributions from [rambo](https://github.com/rambo/TinyWire) and [svoisen](https://github.com/svoisen/TinyWire)
